In this city, Numpy is planning to build a skyscraper named Arithmeticia. He is a Python programmer. This person already has a blueprint of a skyscraper created by another architect but, he is not satisfied and would like to make some changes to it. The number of floors in a skyscraper is 20, the width is 5000, and the height is 500. Since Numpy is a techie he wants you to write a computer program using the knowledge of arithmetic operators you have learned in this class to make changes in the blueprint. Here is what you have to do: <br> <ol> <li> Create variables of floors, width, and height and store 20, 5000, and 500 inside it respectively.</li> <li> Print the initial height and width Increase height by 100 and print it.</li> <li> Subtract 200 from the width to allocate the space for windows and print that.</li> <li> Calculate the total floor area and print that.</li> <li> Considering each room will have an area of 5000, calculate the number of rooms per floor and print that.</li></ol> "
